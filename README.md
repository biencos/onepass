[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Onepass is a safe password manager, that will help You store your login details safely. Currently there are 2 versions of the project:

## Offline
Onepass is a locally installed app, that securely stores login details. This version of the project works without internet connection so there is no leakage of data due to the network.
If You want to learn more about it, go to the **offline** folder:
```sh
cd offline
```


## Online
Onepass is a web app, that securely stores login details. This version of the project requires internet connection. The main advantage of online password managers over offline versions is a reduced risk of losing passwords as a result of theft or damage to a single computer.
If You want to learn more about this version, go to the **online** folder:
```sh
cd online
```
